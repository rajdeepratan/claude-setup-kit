# Creating Skill Files

Skills = **step-by-step recipes** Claude can load on demand. Unlike CLAUDE.md (always in context) or rules (loaded per-path), a skill's body only enters context when it's invoked — so long reference material costs almost nothing until needed.

Derive tasks from the repo's domain — think "add a new X", "create a Y", "wire up a Z". Examples: `add-endpoint`, `add-migration`, `add-page`, `add-metric`, `add-handler`.

## Check Superpowers First

Before creating a new skill, check whether a superpowers skill already covers the task. Run `/help` in Claude Code or check `.claude/plugins/` to see what's installed. Common superpowers skills that teams often duplicate unnecessarily: `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`. If a superpowers skill covers it — don't create a redundant one.

## What Deserves a Skill

Create a skill when a task meets all three:
1. **Repeatable** — done regularly, not once
2. **Multi-step** — more than 2–3 non-obvious steps
3. **Pattern-dependent** — getting it wrong without the recipe would produce inconsistent code

If a task is trivial, one-off, or fully handled by an agent's built-in workflow — skip it.

## File Location — Directory with `SKILL.md`

Anthropic's current spec: each skill is a **directory** containing a `SKILL.md` entrypoint, not a flat `.md` file.

```
.claude/skills/
└── add-endpoint/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Entrypoint (required)
    ├── template.ts       # Optional template Claude fills in
    └── examples/
        └── sample.ts     # Optional example output
```

The directory name becomes the slash command (`/add-endpoint`). Supporting files are only loaded when `SKILL.md` references them — keep large reference docs, templates, and scripts in separate files so they don't consume context until needed.

> **Note:** Flat `.claude/commands/*.md` files still work as a legacy form (Anthropic merged commands into skills). Prefer the `SKILL.md` directory format for new skills.

## What Each `SKILL.md` Must Include

1. **Reference file to read first** — the rule or source file that governs this area
2. **Steps in dependency order** — what to do and in what sequence
3. **Code snippets** — using this repo's actual patterns, not generic examples
4. **Verify checklist** — how to confirm the task was done correctly

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Split reference material into sibling files.

Every `SKILL.md` must include the generated-by marker in its frontmatter — see `claude-setup-instructions.md` § Generated File Markers.

## File Skeleton

```markdown
---
name: add-endpoint
description: Add a new HTTP endpoint — use when the user asks to create an API route, add a handler, or expose a new service operation
generated_by: [package]@[version]
generated_at: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
---

## Before Starting

Read: `.claude/rules/api.md`

## Steps

1. [first step]
2. [second step]
...

## Verify

- [ ] [check one]
- [ ] [check two]
```

## Useful Frontmatter Fields (all optional except `description`)

| Field | When to use |
|---|---|
| `description` | Required. Front-load the key trigger phrase — the combined text is truncated at 1,536 characters in Claude's skill listing. |
| `when_to_use` | Extra trigger phrases (e.g. "user asks to add a route"). Counts toward the 1,536-char cap. |
| `allowed-tools` | Pre-approve specific tools for this skill (e.g. `Bash(npm run *)`). Skill still follows global permissions for unlisted tools. |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Only the user can run this (`/skill-name`). Use for skills with side effects — deploys, commits, message sends. |
| `argument-hint` | Autocomplete hint, e.g. `[endpoint-name]`. |
| `paths` | Glob that limits when Claude auto-loads the skill, e.g. `"src/api/**/*.ts"`. |
| `context: fork` + `agent` | Run the skill in a subagent (`Explore`, `Plan`, or a custom agent). Skill content becomes the subagent's prompt. |

Use `$ARGUMENTS` in the body for the full argument string, or `$0` / `$1` / `$ARGUMENTS[N]` for positional args.

## Scope

- The 80% happy path only — edge cases belong in code comments, not skill files
- Derive tasks from what developers actually do in this repo
- Do not create skills for one-off tasks or anything already handled by an agent workflow

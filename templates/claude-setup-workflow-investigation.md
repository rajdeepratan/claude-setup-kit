# Investigation Flow

Short, research-only flow used by `/investigate`. No branching, no PR, no verification phase. Output is a findings report.

This file is loaded by `/investigate`.

## Phase I1 — Investigation Intake

1. Parse input. Accept:
   - A free-form symptom description
   - A bug report or issue link the user pastes
   - Nothing → ask: **"What's the symptom you want me to investigate?"**
2. Extract: expected vs. actual behavior, reproduction conditions (environment, inputs, frequency), recent changes that might be related
3. Ask clarifying questions until the investigation scope is clear

## Phase I2 — Investigate (Read-Only)

**Superpowers skill (if installed):** `superpowers:systematic-debugging`

1. If superpowers is installed, invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
2. Reproduce the issue — in code, in a test, or by tracing
3. Bisect / trace / read the code to find the root cause
4. **No edits to application code.** Scratch files, temporary test files in a sandboxed location, and logging are fine — but no PR-bound changes
5. If unable to reproduce, document what was tried and what conclusion was reached (intended behavior / environmental / need more info)

---

## Phase I3 — Report & Hand-Off

1. Produce a findings report. Required sections:
   - **Summary** — one-line conclusion (confirmed / not reproducible / intended behavior / needs more info)
   - **Reproduction** — exact steps, or "unable to reproduce" with what was tried
   - **Root cause** — what's actually happening (or best hypothesis)
   - **Affected scope** — which versions, environments, users
   - **Suggested next step** — fix approach, deferral rationale, or further investigation needed
2. **Write the report to a file:** `.claude/investigations/investigation-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`. Create the `.claude/investigations/` directory if it doesn't exist.
3. Print the report in chat as well
4. **Hand off:** end with — *"Investigation complete. Want me to fix this? Run `/code` to start the fix."*

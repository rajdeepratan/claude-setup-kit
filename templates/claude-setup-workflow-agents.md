# Agent Selection & Self-Sufficiency

This file is loaded alongside `claude-setup-workflow.md` by every workflow command (`/code`, `/quick`, `/investigate`). It covers which agent handles which task type, and the rules that keep the workflow running without unnecessary user prompts.

## Agent Selection Table

Claude self-selects the correct agent based on the task type. The user will never specify.

| Task type | Agent |
|---|---|
| Frontend / UI / components | `frontend-developer` or equivalent |
| API / backend / services | `api-builder` or equivalent |
| Database / migrations / queries | `database-developer` or equivalent |
| Tests only | `test-writer` or equivalent |
| Bug investigation and fix | `debugger` or equivalent |
| After any implementation | `code-reviewer` (always) |
| Branch, push, PR | `git` agent (always) |

If the required agent does not exist in `.claude/agents/`, create it on the fly and notify the user.

## Multiple Coding Agents — Mandatory

Always create more than one coding agent when setting up a repo. At minimum:

- `developer` — general-purpose fallback
- One specialist per major concern in the codebase (e.g. `frontend-developer`, `api-builder`, `test-writer`, `debugger`)

The `developer` agent is the last resort — invoke specialist agents first when the task clearly fits one.

---

## Self-Sufficiency Rules

- Claude selects agents based on task type — never ask the user which agent to use
- If a needed agent is missing, create it silently and notify the user after
- The change-shipping loop (`/code`, `/quick`) runs without user intervention except for the four mandatory gates: **plan confirmation** (Phase 3), **branch decision** (Phase 4), **PR target + reviewers** (Phase 8), and **branch cleanup** (Phase 10)
- Every phase with a named superpowers skill MUST invoke that skill via the `Skill` tool (if superpowers is installed) before acting — do not paraphrase from memory

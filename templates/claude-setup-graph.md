name: Claude Setup — Graphify Integration
description: Setup-time offer that builds a queryable code graph for the repo, so agents can query the call graph instead of exploring raw files. Saves ~10–30k tokens per non-trivial command run. Runs only inside /setup-claude. Follows show-commands-then-ask pattern — never auto-installs.

# Graphify Integration (Setup-Time Offer)

Graphify builds an AST-level knowledge graph of a repo — nodes for functions/classes, edges for call graphs and relationships, blast-radius queries, god-node detection. When present in a repo, agents read a pre-built graph summary and/or query the graph directly instead of grepping raw files for scope, dependency, and affected-surface questions.

**This is not a preflight check.** Do not check for Graphify on every command — it is a repo-level dependency, offered once during `/setup-claude`. Once installed, its own `graphify claude install` wires a PreToolUse hook on Glob/Grep that auto-surfaces graph context for every subsequent command, with no extra guide-side enforcement needed.

---

## Ask-First — NEVER Auto-Install

Even though every install step is a pure shell command Claude could run via Bash without further prompts, the integration **must not install silently or by default**. Show the user the exact commands, then ask. Capability is not consent.

This applies even when the user said "sure" to the offer in principle — the y/n prompt is for the final commands, not the intent.

---

## When to Offer (language-fit gate)

Offer only when ALL of these hold:

- The repo is being set up via `/setup-claude` (fresh or Update flow)
- `graphify` is not already on `PATH` (`command -v graphify` returns empty)
- **≥ 70% of non-trivial source files** are in Graphify-supported languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, Ruby, C#, Kotlin, Scala, PHP, Swift, Lua, Zig, PowerShell, Elixir, Objective-C, Julia, Verilog, SystemVerilog, Vue, Svelte, Dart

If the repo is mostly YAML / shell / config / templates / a language not in the list above, **skip silently** — no offer, no prompt. Graphify adds no value where it can't parse.

## Why It Matters (show verbatim to the user when offering)

> **Why Graphify saves tokens on this workflow:**
>
> - Today, `/code` on a non-trivial change spends ~10–30k tokens on raw file exploration (grep/glob to figure out call graphs, affected surface, dependencies). With Graphify indexed, agents read a summary + do targeted graph queries instead.
> - `/investigate` is the biggest single win — blast-radius analysis is exactly what the graph is built for. Expect ~15–30k tokens saved per investigation.
> - Phase 2 *Affected surface* stops being a guess and becomes a graph query.
>
> **Costs:**
>
> - **Python 3.10+ and `uv` (or `pipx`/`pip`)** installed on your machine
> - Initial indexing takes a few seconds on small repos, several minutes on large monorepos
> - One-time **~5–15k tokens** to synthesise `graphify-out/SUMMARY.md` (the human-readable version of the graph report) right after install
> - The graph must be kept fresh — run `graphify watch .` in a terminal tab, or re-run `graphify .` after major refactors, to avoid Claude citing relationships that no longer exist

## Install Flow

1. **Print the "Why it matters" block** above.
2. **Show the exact four commands** that will run, so the user sees what they're authorising:
   ```bash
   uv tool install graphifyy        # installs the CLI (note: double-y package name)
   graphify install                 # Graphify's own first-run setup
   graphify .                       # indexes this repo — seconds to minutes
   graphify claude install          # appends CLAUDE.md section + installs Glob/Grep PreToolUse hook
   ```
   If `uv` is not available on the user's system, fall back to `pipx install graphifyy` or `pip install graphifyy` — mention both alternatives before asking.
3. **Ask explicitly:** *"Install and index with these commands? (y/n)"* — no default-to-yes, no shortcut flag.
4. **On yes:** run the four commands in order via Bash, stopping on any failure and surfacing the error verbatim. The user still sees each Bash call through the normal permission-prompt flow unless they've pre-allowed shell commands.
5. **On yes — after step 4 succeeds:** synthesise `graphify-out/SUMMARY.md` from `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` per `claude-setup-graph-summary.md`. **No second prompt** — the user's yes to Graphify covers this. ~5–15k tokens, one-time.
6. **On no:** skip silently. Do not re-ask during this session. On the next `/setup-claude` re-run (Update flow), the offer fires again.

## Critical Ordering — kit's CLAUDE.md FIRST

`graphify claude install` appends a section to `CLAUDE.md` and writes a PreToolUse hook to `.claude/settings.json` — both files `/setup-claude` itself manages. The rule:

> **`/setup-claude` writes its own `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json` FIRST, then `graphify claude install` runs LAST.**

If Graphify runs first, the kit's subsequent `CLAUDE.md` write overwrites Graphify's appended section. By running Graphify last, Graphify's additions sit in a marker-less section that the kit's `generated_by` marker system treats as user-edited — safe from future kit re-runs.

---

## After a Successful Install

Tell the user, verbatim:

> *"Graphify is installed and this repo is indexed. I've also synthesised `graphify-out/SUMMARY.md` — the human-readable version of the graph report (read it once to anchor your mental model). Open a separate terminal tab and run `graphify watch .` to keep the graph in sync with file changes — without it, the graph goes stale and agents may cite relationships that no longer exist. The Claude Code Glob/Grep hook is now active; agents will see graph context automatically on the next command."*

---

## When a Graph is Present (runtime usage)

The PreToolUse hook Graphify installs handles the default case — agents see graph context before any Glob or Grep call. Two phase-specific reinforcements in case the hook misses:

- **`claude-setup-workflow.md` Phase 2 — Affected surface:** *"If `GRAPH_REPORT.md` exists at repo root, consult it for blast-radius of the entry-point symbols rather than guessing from filename proximity."*
- **`claude-setup-workflow-investigation.md` Phase I2:** *"If a graph is available, consult it first. Investigation is the scenario the graph is built for — blast radius, call paths, god-node identification."*

**Skip the graph on trivial / lean paths:** `/code` auto-detected trivial, and `/quick`. The graph-load overhead (~2–5k tokens) exceeds the value on typo-sized work, and the trivial path shouldn't be greping much anyway.

---

## Caveats

- **Stale-graph correctness risk.** A graph that's 2 weeks old in an actively-refactored repo will make Claude cite relationships that no longer exist. `graphify watch` is not optional — it's the mitigation. Tell the user this explicitly.
- **Language coverage is partial.** Non-supported files (YAML, shell, config) are not in the graph. Claude still greps those; the graph just covers the code surface it supports.
- **Graphify is pre-1.0 (v0.5.0).** Interfaces may shift upstream. If `graphify` commands change, re-run `npx claude-setup-kit` to pull updated guide content.
- **Never add a `--yes` / auto-install flag to this offer.** Principle: the user sees what's being installed on their machine.
